## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)

## Next Level Week - Booster

Next Level Week is a micro bootcamp promoted by Rocketseat to teach fullstack development with Typescript - Node.js for the backend, ReactJS on the web frontend and React Native for mobile - in a hands-on experience, by creating a fully functional application with web and mobile frontends. One single programming language to dominate the entire development cycle, using technologies seen in many of the big companies today.


During the Next Level Week, Rocketseat provides 5 online classes - 1 per day from Monday to Friday - teaching how to build an app from scratch and finishing with an MVP. In this edition of the event we developed Happy.

## Happy

Happy is a platform that allows people to find local orphanages and appoint a visit to the children that lives there.
This app aims to make it easier to organize visiting schedules so it is all about making the orphanage's kids happier by spending some time with them.


### Layout

The app design was made by Rocketseat using [Figma](https://figma.com).

You can se the project mockup for the web interface in [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/mDEbnoojksG4w8sOxmudh3/Happy-Web?node-id=0%3A1).
And the mobile frontend is available at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/X27FfVxAgy9f5IFa7ONlph/Happy-Mobile?node-id=0%3A1).
